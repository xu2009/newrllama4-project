quick_llama_reset()

\description{
Clears cached model and context objects, forcing fresh initialization
on the next call to quick_llama().
}
\details{
This function is useful when:
\itemize{
\item You want to free up memory used by cached models
\item You need to force reloading of models (e.g., after model files change)
\item You want to switch to different model configurations
\item You're experiencing issues with cached state
}

After calling this function, the next call to \code{quick_llama()} will
re-initialize the backend, reload the model, and recreate the context.
