Description: Provides R bindings to the llama.cpp library for running large language models.
    This package uses a lightweight architecture where the C++ backend library is downloaded
    at runtime rather than bundled with the package. After installation, users must run
    install_newrllama() to download the appropriate pre-compiled backend library for their
    system. Supports text generation, tokenization, and chat template functionality.
